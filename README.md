# The-Filipino-Channel.bundle
A Plex channel for The Filipino Channel, http://tfc.tv

NOTE! This channel requires a valid TFC.tv subscription!

This little project is far from production quality! 
It is only verified to work on Plex Media Player 1.2.2 on Mac OS X and Raspberry Pi.

Plex Media Player 1.2.3, 1.2.4 and 1.2.5 will NOT work due to problems with the newer ffmpeg libraries.

UPDATE! Mac OSX PMP 1.3.0 pre-release works! https://nightlies.plex.tv/public-test/plexmediaplayer/public-testing/1.3.0.641-6bcdfb25/
(I haven't tried the RPi version yet...)

The iOS player work at least on iPhone 4 and 5.

Due to inconsistencies in the TFC.tv database some movies and shows will not play and I can't see anyway to solve that.

Please note that is is my first attempt to make a Plex channel and I have copied extensively from many different channels
and the code works for me but may not be written in an optimum way...

Nevertheless, enjoy!
