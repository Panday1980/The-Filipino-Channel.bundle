# The-Filipino-Channel.bundle
A Plex channel for The Filipino Channel, http://tfc.tv

NOTE! This channel requires a valid TFC.tv subscription!

Please note that is is my first attempt to make a Plex channel and I have copied extensively from many different channels
and the code works for me but may not be written in an optimum way...

Nevertheless, enjoy!


UPDATED 2017-06-25  Rewritten to use the TFC website since the iPhone App API was closed down.

Horrible code right now but it seems to work!!!
                   
Without studying the Kodi TFC in [https://github.com/benaranguren/nuodtayo.tv/blob/master/plugin.video.tfctv/](https://github.com/benaranguren/nuodtayo.tv/blob/master/plugin.video.tfctv/ "https://github.com/benaranguren/nuodtayo.tv/blob/master/plugin.video.tfctv/")  and [https://github.com/cmik/cmik.xbmc/blob/master/plugin.video.tfctv/](https://github.com/cmik/cmik.xbmc/blob/master/plugin.video.tfctv/ "https://github.com/cmik/cmik.xbmc/blob/master/plugin.video.tfctv/") I would never been able to fix it...
