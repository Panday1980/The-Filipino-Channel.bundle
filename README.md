# The-Filipino-Channel.bundle
A Plex channel for The Filipino Channel, http://tfc.tv

To install follow the instructions here: https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201187656-How-do-I-manually-install-a-channel-

NOTE! This channel requires a valid TFC.tv subscription!

Please note that is is my first attempt to make a Plex channel and I have copied extensively from many different channels
and the code works for me but may not be written in an optimum way...

Nevertheless, enjoy!

Horrible code right now but it seems to work!!!
                   
Without studying the Kodi TFC in [https://github.com/benaranguren/nuodtayo.tv/blob/master/plugin.video.tfctv/](https://github.com/benaranguren/nuodtayo.tv/blob/master/plugin.video.tfctv/ "https://github.com/benaranguren/nuodtayo.tv/blob/master/plugin.video.tfctv/")  and [https://github.com/cmik/cmik.xbmc/blob/master/plugin.video.tfctv/](https://github.com/cmik/cmik.xbmc/blob/master/plugin.video.tfctv/ "https://github.com/cmik/cmik.xbmc/blob/master/plugin.video.tfctv/") I would never been able to fix it...

Big thanks to @benaranguren and @cmik
