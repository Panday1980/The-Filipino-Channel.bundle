# The-Filipino-Channel.bundle
A Plex channel for The Filipino Channel, http://tfc.tv

NOTE! This channel requires a valid TFC.tv subscription!

UPDATED 2017-06-25  Rewritten to use the TFC website since the iPhone App API was closed down.
                    Horrible code right now but it seems to work!!!

Please note that is is my first attempt to make a Plex channel and I have copied extensively from many different channels
and the code works for me but may not be written in an optimum way...

Nevertheless, enjoy!
